        <p class="thin"> Rishika went to a college trip to Europe on 11th december 2018. On the first day of her trip she was travelling to Hungary

          in the train where she saw a guy wearing a black hoddie and carring a guitar. There was this small boy who requested him
          
          to play a song for him? He could not refuse him and started singing a song. Coincidentally it was her favourite song.
        </p>

      <div id="couple-5" class="column column-couple-text is-5">
        <br class="is-hidden-touch">
        <br class="is-hidden-touch">
        <p class="thin"> She completely got immersed in the song that she forgot that it was her station.
          She left the train with her friends but she could not get him out of her mind.
          After reaching to their desitination in Hungary she came to know that it was him the guy in black hoodie as their tourist guide.
          
          <br/></br>
          She felt so Happy that she started jumping with joy and everyone was shocked to see her, she felt embarrassed.
